This is our TeenServe group project for CSC444 for Fall 2017.

The objective of this project is to design and implement a web-based application called TeenServ that offers a marketplace to hire local teenagers to provide specific services, such as babysitting, lawn-mowing, snow-shoveling, yard-cleanup, etc. Potential clients are adults who seek teenagers in their area who are willing to perform tasks for them. Teenagers (aged 13-19, inclusive) register on the site and specify the services they are willing to perform and at what price. The TeenServ application you will create should automatically connect clients and teenagers if there is a good match. A key requirement for your service is that the distance for the teenager to get from his/her house to the client be limited (say to 1km or so, perhaps depending on the age of the teenager).
