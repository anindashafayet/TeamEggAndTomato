### 2.1.2

* Removed older way of initializing assets, relying on config/initializers/assets.rb for all versions of Rails.

### 2.1.1

* Reverted asset initialization back to working state for versions prior to Rails5.

## 2.1.0

* Updated filterrific for Rails 5 compatibility:
    * Turbolinks compatibility (thanks @olegantonyan)
    * Updated to Ruby 2.2.2 in CI test matrix
    * Added Ruby 2.3.1 to CI test matrix (thanks @rodrigoargumedo)
    * Fixed #stringify_keys deprecation warning (thanks @olegantonyan)
* When generating sorting headers, allow usage of HTML (e.g., for icons) using #safe_join (thanks @ScottKolo)
* Improved param casting to Int: hyphens and zeros (thanks @grit96)


### 2.0.5

* Feature: Allow disabling of session persistence by passing `false` as
  `:persistence_id` option.
* Fix: Direction indicators on sortable headers are now correct.
* Fix: Make JS event observers work with TurboLinks.
* Fix: Make reset_filterrific_url available in controller.



### 2.0.4

* Objectify nested params so that they render correctly on the form when
  restored from session or URL params.
* Don't convert strings that almost look like integers to integers. Example:
  `"0123"` as part of a phone number should not be converted to `123`.



### 2.0.3

* Cleaned up obsolete option names



### 2.0.2

* Fixed bugs in ActionControllerExtension
* Improved test coverage



### 2.0.1

* Fixed regression with Rails 3.2 (doesn't support `#deep_stringify_keys`)



# 2.0.0

API changes:

* Filterrific model API option names have changed.
* Better initialization of Filterrific via `initialize_filterrific` method:
    * It resets the filter params, so the `reset_filterrific` action is not required any more.
    * It persists filter params in session.
* Simplified `@filterrific.find` method to load collection from DB.
  Replaces `Student.filterrific_find(@filterrific)`
* The `form_for_filterrific` form builder doesn't override the standard
  `form_for` method any more.
* Dropped support for Ruby 1.8.7 (because of 1.9 Hash syntax)
* Dropped support for Rails <= 3.0.0 (because of ActiveRecord
  bug fixes in 3.1, and use of asset pipeline)



### 1.4.3

* Handle case where Filterrific filter params are empty.



### 1.4.2

* Updated initialization of ActiveRecord and ActionView extensions again



### 1.4.1

* Updated initialization of ActiveRecord and ActionView extensions



### 1.4.0

* Better support for new versions of Rails (integration tests are done in filterrific_demo)
* Fixed asset pipeline for filterrific-spinner.gif.
* Isolate_namespace
* Update Gem dependencies
* Switch from Rspec to Minitest
* Require Rails 3.1 or greater



### 1.3.1

* Changed ParamSet#select_options so that a complete hash can be assigned



## 1.3.0

* Added ParamSet#select_options (thanks @pnomolos).
* Added ParamSet#signature to quickly test two param_sets for equality.
* Bugfix: When using with Rails 4.0: Fixed ‘wrong number of arguments 0 for 1’ exception (thanks @sebboh).
* Bugfix: jQuery bug in `form_for` helper (thanks @sebboh).
* Bugfix: removed duplicate dependency in .gemspec.

* Updated documentation.
* Updated Gemfile source
* Refactored ParamSet initialization.
* Refactored ActiveRecordExtension initialization.



## 1.2.0

* Added simple wrapper for Filterrific::ParamSet.new so that it can be
  instantiated with Filterrific.new instead of Filterrific::ParamSet.new.
* Overrode ActionView's form_for to add filterrific magic when applied to a
  Filterrific object.
* Fixed bug with javascript periodic observer, changed css selector class to
  avoid conflicts.
* Moved observe_form_field jquery plugin into filterrific namespace to avoid
  conflicts.



## 1.1.0

* Major refactor.
* Added specs.
* Tied in Rails asset pipeline.
* Added gh-pages branch for documentation.



### 1.0.1

* Bug fix: Replaced stringify_keys with map.to_s (filter_names is an Array, not a Hash!).



# 1.0.0

* Support for Rails 3.1.
* New model api.



## 0.1.0, released 2010-08-01

* Replicate functionality of Rails 2.3 version.



### 0.0.1, released 2010-07-30

* Initial setup.
